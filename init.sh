#!/bin/bash

# When you run this command, it searches for all files with the ".sh" extension 
# in the current directory and its subdirectories. For each of these files, it sets 
# the execute permission, making them executable shell scripts if they weren't already. 

# This is often done when you have a collection of shell script files that you
# want to make executable so that you can run them from the command line.
